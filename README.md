Compost King makes composting in your country-side or city home easy, automatic, and smell-free. We hope to lower the barrier of entry to composting to reduce food waste.

## Inspiration
20% of landfills is composed of food-related waste. This waste could be put to good use with widspread composting, but many people are not sure how to. Many may be scared of compost starting to smell. Particularly if you live in the city, like many students, it can be intimidating to start composting. Compost King automates the process. Just add a healthy mix of greens and browns to the Compost King, and it will create a healthy environment for your compost to decompose in a smell-free way.
